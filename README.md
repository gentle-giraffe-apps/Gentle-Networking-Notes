# Gentle Networking Notes

Practical networking and API design patterns for mobile engineers.

## Authorship & Approach

The prose in these notes is largely produced through collaborative drafting with large language models.

I use LLMs to generate initial explanations, explore alternative formulations, and iteratively rewrite sections for clarity and structure. In many cases, the final text is the result of multiple guided rewrites rather than line-by-line manual authorship.

What *is* mine — and what I explicitly stand behind — are:
- the topics chosen,
- the architectural positions taken,
- the trade-offs emphasized,
- the examples included or excluded,
- and the practical guidance distilled from production experience.

I treat LLMs as a high-leverage writing tool, similar to pair programming or technical editing, while retaining full responsibility for technical accuracy, judgment, and intent.

These notes are intended as practical, experience-informed guides rather than academic papers or formal specifications.
